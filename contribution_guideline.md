Welcome everyone to participate in the discussion about AI4Science in the discussion module of our GitHub. The website is [here](https://github.com/deepmodeling/AI4Science101/discussions)

#### Email

Our email address is [ai4science101@deepmodeling.com](ai4science101@deepmodeling.com). If you are interested in sharing your knowledge about any particular aspect of AI for Science (e.g. a common AI tool, practical guidance, an overview of a scientific topic, etc.), we encourage you to send us an email before you start preparing the material. 

#### Slack group

In addition to our reading documents, you can also join the AI4Science101 [Slack channel](https://aiforscience.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-1bdof1jmf-YtIjkUVA5DquXguEiOXGPQ#/shared-invite/email) to introduce yourself, drop comments/feedback, discuss related material, network with peers, and contribute new material.

## How to make a new request
#### Make a new issue

If you have any suggestions for any of the documents, have any new requests for material that you are interested in, or you are interested in contributing your knowledge and expertise to this initiative, we encourage you to participate in the AI4Science101 project.

 In order to increase the visibility of all requests and comments, and to facilitate the organization of this project, we recommend that you submit a new issue with examples shown below.

 In order to make your request/comments more organized, we hope you help us classify the type of request by stating in the title as one of  [error report|question|new material request|new material contribution|others], e.g., [new material request] Protein Structure Prediction Tutorial.
 
## How to make corrections to the docs/pull request

If you find any inaccurate expressions/typos/grammatical errors in our documents or you would like to add more relevant content to our documents, you are welcome to submit a pull request on our GitHub. The community's volunteers will merge your pull request after reviewing your submission.

There are two ways for you to modify the documentï¼š

First, if you just want to modify a sentence or a few sentences, you can do it directly in the document,as shown below.

Then find the place you want to modify and modify it.

You can then describe your changes at the bottom of the page and submit them.

(Note: please commit pr to the **devel branch**)

Second, if you want to modify a lot of places, we recommend that you fork to your own repository to modify, and then create a pull request after modifying all the places.

After making changes in your repository, you can create a pull request.

Then you can click the button pointed by the red arrow to open a new pull request.

It is worth noting that you must switch to the devel branch before submitting the pull request. After collecting and sorting out a certain number of changes, we will merge them into the main branch, as shown below. So when submitting a pull request, please change the comparison branch to the devel branch, as shown below.

In addition, due to the problem of markdown format, some formulas of documents on GitHub may appear garbled. Please refer to the content on the project website. Our project [website](ai4science101.deepmodeling.com)
